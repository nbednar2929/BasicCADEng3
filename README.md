## SwingArm

### Description
  We were instructed to create a Swing Arm from a group of drawings and dimensions. After we must change dimensions of the swing arm in order to test whether or not it was constrained properly. This will help us prepare for your Onshape certification test.
### Evidence

### Reflection
    I struggled with this one at first because I was drawing on the wrong plane. 
    I needed to create a sketch from the side and just extrude pieces at different depths rather than
    create multiple shapes from multiple planes. I also needed to learn to constrain rough shapes before 
    fully dimensioning geometry.

## FlyCopter_4.1_(Ring&Spinner)

### Description
  As student A I created the ring for this portion of the assignment.

### Reflection
    This was a super simple piece to make. Just some easy sketches and extrudes. 
    Along with the step by step instructions this was an everyday CAD model.

## FlyCopter_4.2_(Key&Prop)

### Description
  As student A I had to create the Key for this portion of the assignment.

### Reflection
    This one was slightly harder because I had to learn to use min and maxes when allowing extrusion and movent. 
    I also had to use a linear pattern to extrude the inlets of the key ridges and it was hard to find the ridge to patter off.

## FlyCopter_4.3_(Assembling_The_Launcher)

### Description
  As student A I had to assemble and mate the Fly Copter together.

### Reflection
    This was also pretty easy. Just some simple fastened mates and revolute mates. 
    There was one slide mate that I had to connect to a mate a created previously. 
    I also created limits for the slide mate which is a useful tool to know how to use.

## FlyCopter_4.4-4.5_(Let's_Fly_From_This_Branch)

### Description
  I had to create a seperate branch for the assembly and make a modification of my choice to the "Prop".

### Reflection
    I did not like this part of the assignment. The branching in Onshape still confuses me.
    I don't understand how to create a branch of a branch easily.

## MultiPartDesignPractice

### Description
  I must create a multi-part design based on drawings and minimal amounts of dimensions. 
  Afterwards I had to make 3 different variations to the part with the purpose of braking my assembly. 
  This intern would force me to learn how to properly dimension. 
### Evidence
  https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/dac4be3b843869eb81761d59/v/371ede44ce9a487e310ab410/e/71fa4ea71f0dddf48e0bd07e?renderMode=0&uiState=63582e5912e82f08ee25ac28

  Part after third varation:

### Reflection
    I really sturggled with this assignment because I wasn't dimensioning the parts based off each other. 
    I was putting in dimensions that were given to me rather than utilizing the "use" tool. 
    If I used the "use" tool then the 3 variations of the part I made would have changed in context with one another,
    meaning I wouldn't have to change different parts based on their dimensions. I'm also happy I used the branch feature
    in order to allow myself to look at the previous changes I made which were only built on with the different variations.
