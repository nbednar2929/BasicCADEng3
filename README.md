## SwingArm

### Description
  We were instructed to create a Swing Arm from a group of drawings and dimensions. After we must change dimensions of the swing arm in order to test whether or not it was constrained properly. This will help us prepare for your Onshape certification test.

### Reflection
    I struggled with this one at first because I was drawing on the wrong plane. 
    I needed to create a sketch from the side and just extrude pieces at different depths rather than
    create multiple shapes from multiple planes. I also needed to learn to constrain rough shapes before 
    fully dimensioning geometry.

## FlyCopter

### Description
  As student A I created the ring, key, assemble and mate it all together,
  and create a branch to create my own variation of the FlyCopter's design.

### Reflection
    The ring was a super simple piece to make. Just some easy sketches and extrudes. 
    The key was slightly harder because I had to learn to use min and maxes when allowing extrusion.
    I also had to use a linear pattern to extrude the inlets of the key ridges and it was hard to find the face I needed to select.
    Assembly was also pretty easy. Just some simple fastened mates and revolute mates. 
    There was one slide mate that I had to use with a mate I created previously on the key.
    I also created limits for the slide mate which restricted its movement.
    Finally I did not like branching this assignment. The branching in Onshape still confuses me.
    I don't understand how to create a branch of a branch easily.

## MultiPartDesignPractice

### Description
  I must create a multi-part design based on drawings and minimal amounts of dimensions. 
  Afterwards I had to make 3 different variations to the part with the purpose of braking my assembly. 
  This intern would force me to learn how to properly dimension.

### Reflection
    I really sturggled with this assignment because I wasn't dimensioning the parts based off each other. 
    I was putting in dimensions that were given to me rather than utilizing the "use" tool. 
    If I used the "use" tool then the 3 variations of the part I made would have changed in context with one another,
    meaning I wouldn't have to change different parts based on their dimensions. I'm also happy I used the branch feature
    in order to allow myself to look at the previous changes I made which were only built on with the different variations.
