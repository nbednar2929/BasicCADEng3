## SwingArm

### Description
  We were instructed to create a Swing Arm from a group of drawings and dimensions. After we must change dimensions of the swing arm in order to test whether or not it was constrained properly. This will help us prepare for your Onshape certification test.

### Reflection
    I struggled with this one at first because I was drawing on the wrong plane. 
    I needed to create a sketch from the side and just extrude pieces at different depths rather than
    create multiple shapes from multiple planes. I also needed to learn to constrain rough shapes before 
    fully dimensioning geometry.

## FlyCopter_4.1_(Ring&Spinner)

### Description
  As student A I created the ring for this portion of the assignment.

### Reflection
    This was a super simple piece to make. Just some easy sketches and extrudes.

## FlyCopter_4.2_(Key&Prop)

### Description
  As student A I had to create the Key for this portion of the assignment.

### Reflection
    This one was slightly harder because I had to learn to use min and maxes when allowing extrusion and movent. 
    I also had to use a linear pattern to extrude the inlets of the key ridges.

## FlyCopter_4.3_(Assembling_The_Launcher)

### Description
  As student A I had to assemble and mate the Fly Copter together.

### Reflection
    This was also pretty easy. Just some simple fastened mates and revolute mates. 
    There was one slide mate that I had to connect to a mate a created previously. 
    I also created limits for the slide mate which is a useful tool to know how to use.

## FlyCopter_4.4-4.5_(Let's_Fly_From_This_Branch)

### Description
  I had to create a seperate branch for the assembly and make a modification of my choice to the "Prop".

### Reflection
    I did not like this part of the assignment. The branching in Onshape still confuses me.
    I don't understand how to create a branch of a branch easily.
