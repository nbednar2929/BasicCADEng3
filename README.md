## Swing Arm

### Description
  We were instructed to create a Swing Arm from a group of drawings and dimensions. After we must change dimensions of the swing arm in order to test whether or not it was constrained properly. This will help us prepare for your Onshape certification test.

### Reflection
    I struggled with this one at first because I was drawing on the wrong plane. 
    I needed to create a sketch from the side and just extrude pieces at different depths rather than
    create multiple shapes from multiple planes. I also needed to learn to constrain rough shapes before 
    fully dimensioning geometry.

## Fly Copter

### Description
  As student A I created the ring, key, assemble and mate it all together,
  and create a branch to create my own variation of the FlyCopter's design.

### Reflection
    The ring was a super simple piece to make. Just some easy sketches and extrudes. 
    The key was slightly harder because I had to learn to use min and maxes when allowing extrusion.
    I also had to use a linear pattern to extrude the inlets of the key ridges and it was hard to find the face I needed to select.
    Assembly was also pretty easy. Just some simple fastened mates and revolute mates. 
    There was one slide mate that I had to use with a mate I created previously on the key.
    I also created limits for the slide mate which restricted its movement.
    Finally I did not like branching this assignment. The branching in Onshape still confuses me.
    I don't understand how to create a branch of a branch easily.

## Multi Part Design Practice

### Description
  I must create a multi-part design based on drawings and minimal amounts of dimensions. 
  Afterwards I had to make 3 different variations to the part with the purpose of braking my assembly. 
  This intern would force me to learn how to properly dimension.

### Reflection
    I really sturggled with this assignment because I wasn't dimensioning the parts based off each other. 
    I was putting in dimensions that were given to me rather than utilizing the "use" tool. 
    If I used the "use" tool then the 3 variations of the part I made would have changed in context with one another,
    meaning I wouldn't have to change different parts based on their dimensions. I'm also happy I used the branch feature
    in order to allow myself to look at the previous changes I made which were only built on with the different variations.

## Intermediate CAD Tutorials

### Description
  I was given a set up videos and intructions to follow in order to instill a multitude of CAD tools into my mind.

### Reflection
    All of these assignemnt were fairly easy. Just reviewing stuff I generally knew,
    even if I never truly used them in practice I understood their general principles. 
    All in all it was just some simple assemblies and usage of some slightly newer organizational tools.

## Onshape Certification

### Description
  This is a link to my certificate for passing the Onshape exam.

### Reflection
This exam wasn't all to difficult especially given the practice we were given in class. I did a multitude of practice assemblies and part studios to prepare me for the exam and the helped immensely. During the exam I listened to music to help me stay in the zone and just focus on the exam. It wasn't too difficult, one of the assemblies was nearly identitical to something we did for practice which helped and in the end I only got a single question incorrect on the assemblies/part studio portion of the exam. I felt confident enough about the first portion that when it came to the multiple choice I didn't think too deeply and just went with my gut. All in all I passed the exam in an hour and twenty minutes with a score of 91/100.
